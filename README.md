# Diamond Price Prediction  
### *Exploratory and Advanced Data Analysis*  

This repository contains two comprehensive phases of a data analysis project conducted as part of a coursework.  
The project aims to explore, model, and predict **diamond prices** based on their characteristics using statistical and machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview  

The global diamond market faces persistent challenges of **price transparency** and **valuation inconsistency**.  
This study uses the **Kaggle Diamonds dataset** (also available in Râ€™s `ggplot2` library) to investigate how the *Four Cs* â€” **Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity** â€” along with other physical attributes, influence the retail price of diamonds.

Through a two-stage analytical approach â€” **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Predictive Modeling**, this project builds a strong foundation for accurate price forecasting.

---

## Objectives  
- Identify key variables influencing diamond price.  
- Conduct statistical and visual analysis to understand data patterns.  
- Detect and handle data irregularities (outliers, skewness, multicollinearity).  
- Fit, evaluate, and compare predictive models to determine the best performer.  
- Provide insights and recommendations for transparent diamond pricing.

## Dataset Details  
**Source:** Kaggle / `ggplot2::diamonds`  
**Records:** 53,940  
**Variables:** 10  

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| carat | Diamond weight (size indicator) |
| cut | Quality of diamond cut |
| color | Color grade (D = best, J = worst) |
| clarity | Measure of imperfections |
| depth | Total depth percentage |
| table | Width of top relative to widest point |
| price | Price in USD (response variable) |
| x | Length (mm) |
| y | Width (mm) |
| z | Depth (mm) |

## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

### **Preprocessing**
- Removed invalid records (x, y, or z = 0).  
- Created derived variables:  
  - `depth_percentage = (z / mean(x, y)) * 100`  
  - `volume = x * y * z`  
- Applied **log transformation** on price to correct skewness.  
- Visualized and analyzed outliers.

### **Descriptive Findings**
- Price is highly skewed â€” larger diamonds are rarer and exponentially pricier.  
- **ln(price)** and **ln(carat)** show a strong positive linear relationship.  
- Higher **cut**, **color**, and **clarity** grades correspond to higher prices.  

### **Statistical Tests**
- **Kruskalâ€“Wallis Test** confirmed significant differences in price across cut, color, and clarity categories.  

### **PCA and Clustering**
- **PCA** reduced dimensionality (4 components explain 88.9% of variance).  
- **K-Means Clustering** identified 2 main groups:  
  - **Cluster 1:** Large, high-priced diamonds  
  - **Cluster 2:** Small, lower-priced diamonds  

---

## Phase 2: Advanced Analysis

### **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**  
- Model: `ln(price) ~ ln(carat) + cut + color + clarity`  
- Adjusted RÂ² = **98.3%**  
- Trainâ€“test correlation for predicted vs actual price: **0.979**  
- Residual analysis showed minor violations in independence and homoscedasticity.  

### **Regularization Techniques**  
To address multicollinearity and improve generalization:  
- **Ridge Regression** â€“ reduces coefficient variance.  
- **LASSO Regression** â€“ performs variable selection.  
- **Elastic Net** â€“ hybrid of Ridge and LASSO.  
> ðŸ”¹ *Elastic Net achieved the lowest RMSE and highest RÂ², making it the best linear regularized model.*

### **Random Forest Regression**  
- Built with 500 trees using 80/20 train-test split.  
- Achieved **RÂ² = 0.98** and **Correlation = 0.991** between predicted and actual prices.  
- Top features: **carat**, **x**, **y**, **z** (size dimensions).  
> **Random Forest** outperformed all other models with the lowest RMSE and MAPE.

## Model Comparison Summary  

| Model | RMSE | RÂ² | Remarks |
|--------|------|----|---------|
| Multiple Linear Regression | Moderate | 0.983 | Strong baseline |
| Ridge Regression | Moderate | High | Handles multicollinearity |
| LASSO Regression | Low | High | Performs feature selection |
| Elastic Net | **Lowest (linear)** | **Highest (linear)** | Best regularized linear model |
| Random Forest | **Overall Best** | **0.98+** | Non-linear, most accurate |
